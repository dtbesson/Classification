# Classification
University coursework looking at pre-processing, PCA, kNN and K-means clustering for classification problems.

The data is the vertebral column dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column. 

We were required to pre-process the data, then design one supervised model (kNN), and one unsupervised model (K-means clustering), to classify patients into 'normal' or 'abnormal' classes.

Please find attached the code used for the project (statsml2coursework.ipynb), the report I wrote (classification.pdf), as well as the brief given to us (brief.pdf).
