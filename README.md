# Classification
University coursework looking at supervised and unsupervised classification problems.

The data is the vertebral column dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column. 

We were required to pre-process the data, then design one supervised model (kNN), and one unsupervised model (K-means clustering), to classify patients into 'normal' or 'abnormal' classes. The project also applies techniques such as SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) to address class imbalance, and PCA (principal component analysis) to reduce dimensionality.

Please find attached the code used for the project (statsml2coursework.ipynb), the report I wrote (classification.pdf), as well as the brief given to us (brief.pdf).
